TECHNOLOGIES USED: JavaScript / React / Material-UI

FUTURE ITERATIONS:
</br>-General Technical Debt (& Bug Fixes)
</br>-Feature to add extra Categories
</br>-Usage of database instead of LocalStorage

PURPOSE:
Build an app using these different technologies without referring to tutorials. You can add income or expense records, and that will be shown to you in a PieChart that shows income/expenses, another PieChart that shows the percentage of each Category, and in a Breakdown Table with the full data split by month, with the possibility to filter, sort and download as CSV.

USAGE:
</br>-Usage of Material UI Forms to record data to LocalStorage
</br>-Usage of Material UI Drawer for a side menu and to navigate between pages
</br>-Usage of different React components to get PieCharts, Data Tables and balance totals to display to the user
</br>-Usage of React Routes, Switches, and HashRouter
